    "# 6.2.1 Understanding APIs\n",
    "# Time to get some weather data. During a brainstorming session with Jack, you decide to use the OpenWeatherMap Application Programming Interface (API) to get the weather data for your database. Of course, now comes the tricky part: actually getting the data. You know you can do this using an API–but how do you use an API? Time to dig back in. The weather data is visually displayed on maps for the customer. But, in order for that to happen, you'll need to retrieve the weather from each city in your database. Since this is your first time using an API to get data from a server, your manager would like you to review APIs and how your company retrieves the data.\n",
    "# When a client uses our company's website to search for hotels, our search engine will gather information from a variety of websites based on the client's preferences through APIs. An API call is very similar to navigating to a website. An API points to a URL and collects some data from the webpage or server.\n",
    "# When clients request information from our server through our website, they are making an API call. Once our database has the client's search criteria, our servers search the web for hotels on behalf of the client. Now the roles are reversed: our company is the client requesting information, and all the websites where we derive information are the servers.\n",
    "# Using an API has its limitations because not all information from a server is accessible. Most APIs have tiered services, from free to paid. Free services allow access to limited information, and paid subscriptions provide more access based on the payment plan. Our company has a paid subscription for APIs, but we can only get certain information from websites on hotels such as location, accessibility, rooms, prices, services, and amenities, as well as regional weather data.\n",

    "# Jack loves your work on the scatter plots thus far, and the other tech companies were impressed, too. They ask you to put together something that can help the students explore how to determine correlations between weather data and latitude.\n",
    "# You and Jack decide to divide and conquer this task. He will write the piece on the scientific method and describe how to use linear regression on the scatter plots. You volunteer to use your scatter plot skills to create scatter plots for each weather parameter on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. You'll need to also add a regression line equation and correlation coefficient to each scatter plot, so your first step is to brush up on linear regression. You know this is something Jack uses regularly, so you'll need to really understand it if you want to continue impressing the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear regression is used to find a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The trick is to find something (a dependent variable) that depends on something else (the independent variable) and plot that relationship.\n",
    "# For example, let's say we wanted to understand how weather affects ice cream sales. We would model the linear regression between temperature (the independent variable) and ice cream sales (the dependent variable). Our hypothesis about the relationship would be that as temperatures rise, as they do in summer, more ice cream is sold. We will learn more hypothesis testing and building models in later modules.\n",
    "# For your project, you've already been working with independent and dependent variables. We have enough data to test relationships by creating scatter plots as we've done for each weather parameter vs. latitude. Plotting the data is the first step in determining if there might be an association between the two variables. For our scatter plots, the independent variable is the latitude, plotted on the x-axis, as its value is fixed. When we change the latitude, temperature changes, making it the dependent variable."

For every x-value, or latitude we use in the equation, we will get a predicted temperature value.\n",
